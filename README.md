Here i created a form so i can practice my form-validation skills.


I created an eventlistener which executes on submit. Then i added an empty array in this function. 
When the user tries to submit the form without specific fields filled an error message is pushed in to this Array.
If there is atleast one entry in this Array it will create an div which will display the specific error message in it.
The div disappeares after 3 seconds.
Also the field that wasnt filled correctly gets a red border for 5 seconds.
